# Task: Letter Game
[ť]he problem is combinatorial one [Ì]t's about a game with letters
[ŸŸ]e are given a *dictionary* of words, couple of letters
(in the range **[3, 7]**), and a *mapping* ***letter -> value***
[Ŧ]hen we have to find words, or pair of words in the dictionary,
vhich are composed from the given letters, and have maximum values
[ì]f you didn't understand anything,

I've decided to learn  a little bit *C#* [D]on't understand very much
about languages, but it looks like light version of *Java* [F]or such
small programs **classes** are bit artificial, but there are some things
I like, like *goto* and *var* (cucTeMa Bap) [I]t's a nice language, and 
if you want, you can install **dotnet** and work from **Linux**

[F]or the logic of the program I'm using permutations and combinations
lexicographic algorithms from *Knuth 4A*
